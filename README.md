# JavaScript-Learning
Javascript Code that I wrote while learning Js. Useful to revise quickly as well as to learn from scratch. 
This JavaScript code will be beginner friendly but this will also cover advance concepts of JavaScript.
Multiple Commnets are written in order to help everyone understand what the code is about
Any improvments/addition would be appriciated
